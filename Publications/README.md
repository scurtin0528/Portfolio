This study presents a method for distributing national Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) across U.S. households using microdata from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CE) for 2017–2021. The analysis adjusts for underreported categories such as healthcare using imputation techniques and provides key inequality metrics, including a Gini coefficient of 0.31–0.33 and a 90/10 ratio of 3.3–3.7. The work supports a more accurate and equitable approach to measuring consumption across income groups.

This research provides an updated framework for constructing a consumption-based metric to analyze poverty and inequality in the U.S. It incorporates imputed service flows (e.g., homeownership, vehicles), in-kind transfers, and the full value of health insurance into the measure. Findings show that consumption-based metrics yield lower poverty and inequality estimates compared to traditional income or expenditure-based measures, and highlight the policy value of improved consumption data.
