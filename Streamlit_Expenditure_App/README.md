# 📌 Project Title:
Interactive Python UI for Analyzing U.S. Expenditure Trends by Demographic
## 🧾 Summary:
I developed a Python-based interactive app using Streamlit that allows users to explore Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) LABSTAT database. The app enables dynamic selection of demographic groups, expenditure categories, and levels of detail, allowing users to visualize how spending patterns change over time and across demographic groups.
## 🔧 Tools & Technologies:
•	Python
•	Streamlit (for the UI)
•	Pandas (for data manipulation)
•	BLS LABSTAT database (public economic data source)
•	Matplotlib / Plotly (optional for visualization, if used)
## ⚙️ Key Features:
•	User interface allows selection of:
o	Demographic group (e.g., age, income, region)
o	Expenditure category (e.g., Housing, Transportation)
o	Level of detail (e.g., summary vs. detailed UCC)
o	Specific expenditure items (e.g., Rent, Gasoline)
•	Real-time visual output of:
o	Spending over time
o	Comparisons between demographics
•	Modular code structure, suitable for extension

## 📈 Impact:
This app enhances the accessibility of government expenditure data by making it explorable through an intuitive web interface. It’s valuable for researchers, policy analysts, and educators interested in exploring trends across time
