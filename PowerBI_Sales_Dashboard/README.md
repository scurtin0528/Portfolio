# 📌Project Title:
Interactive Expenditure Dashboard Using BLS LABSTAT + Power BI
## 🧾 Summary:
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes U.S. consumer expenditures using data pulled from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ LABSTAT database. The dashboard enables users to explore expenditure trends across time, categories, and subcategories using dynamic filters and rich visualizations.
## 🔧 Tools Used:
•	Power BI (data modeling, DAX, visuals)
•	BLS LABSTAT API / public datasets
•	Excel (data prep)
•	Dimensional modeling (fact and dimension tables)
## ⚙️ Key Features:
•	Connected to LABSTAT data structured as fact and dimension tables
•	Includes histograms, line charts, pie charts, and treemaps
•	Allows users to drill down into categories (e.g., Housing → Rent)
•	Supports time series analysis and category-level filtering
•	Model supports flexible slicing by year, expenditure category, and demographic attributes
