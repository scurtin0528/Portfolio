# Project Title:
Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES) Analysis – SAS Sample Code Development
## 🧾 Summary (Sample Write-Up):
I developed the official SAS sample code package used in the Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES) Public-Use Microdata (PUMD) Users' Workshop hosted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This code provides users with tools to load, clean, and analyze CES microdata efficiently. It supports reproducible workflows and facilitates deeper analysis of U.S. consumer spending trends.
## 📊 Tools Used:
•	SAS
•	CES PUMD data (Interview and Diary)
•	Documentation from BLS
•	Metadata integration
## ⚙️ What I Did:
•	Import and merge CES Interview and Diary datasets
•	Apply correct weights
•	Perform expenditure analysis by UCC (Universal Classification Code)
•	Generate summary tables for common use cases
•	Worked closely with BLS standards to ensure public usability and replicability
•	The code have been shared publicly on the BLS website: https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd/sas-ucc.zip
## 📈 Impact:
•	Used in training workshops to help new analysts and researchers work with CES data
•	Helps reduce the learning curve for public data users
•	Promotes reproducibility and transparency in federal economic research
