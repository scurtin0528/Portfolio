# 📌 Project Title:
Consolidated Variable Dictionary for CES Microdata (1980s–Present)

## 🧾 Summary:
I developed a consolidated, Excel-based dictionary that integrates 40+ years of CES public-use microdata (PUMD) documentation from disparate year-specific PDF dictionaries. This tool enables researchers to more efficiently identify variable changes over time and to use consistent formatting codes in their data workflows.

## 🔧 Tools Used:
SAS (for parsing and processing PDFs and metadata)

Excel (for the final searchable output)

Adobe Acrobat / OCR (for PDF text extraction where needed)

## 🛠️ What I Did:
Parsed and extracted metadata from 40+ annual PDF documentation files covering both the CES Interview and Diary surveys

Standardized variable names, descriptions, formatting codes, and universes across decades

Created a structured Excel dictionary allowing users to:

Search and filter variables across years

Identify when variables were introduced, changed, or discontinued

Use formatting codes directly in their research pipelines

Delivered the final product in a publicly accessible Excel file hosted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics:

## 📈 Impact:
Streamlines variable discovery and comparison across decades of CES data

Reduces prep time for new CES researchers by eliminating the need to manually comb through 40+ separate PDF files

Enhances reproducibility and documentation in public-sector economic research
