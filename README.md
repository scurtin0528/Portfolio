# Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a selection of projects and publications focused on data analysis, business intelligence, and economic research.These works reflect my experience working with public-sector datasets—especially the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CE)—as well as my technical skills in Power BI, SAS, Python, and SQL. Projects include:  
- Official SAS sample code for the CES Users’ Workshop
- A consolidated variable dictionary covering 40+ years of CES documentation
- Interactive Power BI dashboards using LABSTAT and CE data
- A Streamlit-based Python UI for dynamic demographic and expenditure analysis
- Peer-reviewed research on consumption inequality and poverty measurement

Each project demonstrates a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and data accessibility. You’ll find code samples, dashboards, public links, and summaries of real-world impact.
